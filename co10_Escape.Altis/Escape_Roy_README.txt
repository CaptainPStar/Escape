Escape Roy features:

- Based on the main Escape code - http://forums.bistudio.com/showthread.php?165448-CO08-Escape-Chernarus-Ports-for-Altis-and-Stratis 

- All installations are dynamically created on Mission start so porting to other maps is very easy. I've included missions for these maps:

Altis
Stratis
Chernarus
Takistan
Zargabad
Bystrica
Utes
Fata
clafghan
Podagorsk
N'Ziwasogo
Namalsk
Everon 2014
Thirsk + Thirsk Winter
SFP: Islands
Fallujah
Sahrani
Taviana Island
Tora Bora
Caribou Frontier
Esbekistan
Quesh Kibrul
Spritz Island
Japahto
Nicosia Island
Kellu Island
Isola di Capraia

Icebreakr's maps will also work with Escape Roy but I have not included missions for those due to his wishes for his Arma 2 maps not being used in Arma 3. 

There's also a map from an early access game that might work. I wouldn't know as it would be illegal to use it. Just saying.


- Helicopter Bases. The choppers don't have much fuel. 

- New, Zeus/MCC dynamic object installations for Communication centres, ammo depots, the prison and road blocks.

- Incoming Artillery on screen warning. You don't have much time to run but at least a warning prevents insta-death.

- No aquatic patrols. They were adding too many certain death scenarios when used on the smaller islands. I may add them back in at some point.

- Vehicles using grenade based weapons have been restricted. You'll still find them patroling Communication centres!

- Village patrol markers are now dynamically created at startup. It's a very simple script which adds infantry to areas around buildings. 

- A simpler surprise routine and more surprises. I heard a A-164 fell into enemy hands recently. Just a rumour?

- All air based vehicles are spawned when needed so no airports are needed on the map.

- Options for Karts (warning, unreal Kart placement for those of us who like to drive Karts when escaping prison)

- Options for using the RDS Arma 2 Civ Pack and the Mechs addon. 

- Ammo depots do not always carry every weapon.

- Random Civ boats on the shoreline to prevent players getting stranded.

- Added a building gradient for dynamic installation placements. A steeper gradient will result in more unrealistic placements but will allow more varied locations on hilly maps.

- Triggering the extraction will kick off a surprise or two.

- The rescue choppers are easier to down. A wip idea to trigger an alternate extraction. Protect your rescuers or face a second extraction plan- Players have to travel to another part of the map and meet with a ground or water based rescue team.
